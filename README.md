# Project Title

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Performance
For the performance tests were read 50 3-D models of .obj format. It was done using pure Java and JNI. For pure Java was used this cool library [https://github.com/javagl/Obj](https://github.com/javagl/Obj). The table below shows gain in speed for devices with different power when reading 3-D models of .obj format using pure Java and JNI.
